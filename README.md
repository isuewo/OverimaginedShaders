# Overimagined Shaders
Overimagined no longer exists! But don't worry, we have moved!

# Who are we now?
## We are now called Euphoria Patches!

Euphoria Patches is an add-on for Complementary Shaders (Reimagined and Unbound), developed by [SpacEagle17](https://github.com/SpacEagle17) and [isuewo](https://github.com/isuewo). It aims to extend Complementary with more handcrafted options and settings. All Euphoria options are disabled by default and the user can decide what to enable.

## How can I get the Euphoria Patcher mod?
Currently, you can only get this mod on the Complementary Discord. In the future, the mod will be made available on Modrinth. Further download instructions can be found in the pinned messages of the thread.
## Why does Euphoria Patches need a mod?
[Complementary's license](https://github.com/ComplementaryDevelopment/ComplementaryReimagined/blob/main/License.txt) does not allow us to publish our work as we do not have a "noticeably different from the Original Pack in multiple common gameplay scenarios that must include daytime overworld visuals, regardless of the setting or variable changes in the Modified Pack and/or the Original Pack". We simply add onto Complementary so we obviously don't fall into the green zone. We have had many conversations about this topic with Emin and came to a mutual agreement to distribute it through a patcher where none of Emin's code gets distributed (and by that not breaking the license) and the user has to have Complementary Shaders installed in order to get our add-on. All parties profit from this method.
## When does Euphoria Patches update?
We actually update the add-on with every dev release Emin releases on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/emingt), meaning that when he releases the public version, the add-on should come shortly after!
