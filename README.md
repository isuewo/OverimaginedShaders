# Overimagined Shaders
Overimagined no longer exists! But don't worry, we have moved!

# Who are we now?
## We are now called Euphoria Patches!

# What is Euphoria Patches?
Euphoria Patches is an add-on for Complementary Reimagined Shaders, developed by SpacEagle17 and isuewo. It has the goal of extending Reimagined with more handcrafted options and settings, one of its most important ones being Multicolored Block-lighting. All options are disabled by default and the user can decide what to enable.

# Where can I get the Euphora Patches add-on?

Get the mod from this [pinned message](https://discord.com/channels/744189556768636941/1005837848982847548/1086263167132368926) in the [#euphoria-patches](https://discord.com/channels/744189556768636941/1005837848982847548) thread on the [Complementary Discord](https://discord.gg/A6faFYt).

Euphoria Patches is distributed via a mod which installs the shaderpack if the correct Reimagined version is installed.
Currently you can only get this mod on the Complementary Discord. In the future the mod will be made available on Modrinth. Further download instructions can be found in the pinned messages of the thread.
